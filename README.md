### [About](#about)

WebStudio is my first personal project, what means the very beginning of learning HTML, CSS and
using SASS, first experience of using Git and GitHub, introduction to working with VSCode. WebStudio
is completely based on Figma model and it is an example of exact original look reproduction.

You can see that this repository is cloned and if you go through template links, you'll see a long
chain of 8 repositories which show my growth from the very beginning.
